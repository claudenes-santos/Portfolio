PeerHaul is a peer-to-peer delivery platform that connects drivers with people needing items delivered, providing a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional courier services. Users can post delivery requests, and drivers can accept jobs along their routes, supporting both local and long-haul deliveries.

The platform was developed with a full-stack JavaScript architecture:

-Nuxt.js powers the frontend, providing a performant, SEO-friendly, and responsive interface.
-Node.js handles the backend APIs, business logic, and database interactions, ensuring real-time updates and secure transactions.

This project demonstrates experience in full-stack development, real-time web applications, and scalable production-ready systems.
